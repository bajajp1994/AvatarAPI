1. How did you verify that everything works correctly?

Initial Debugging:

Tested the provided URL:
https://my-jsonserver.typicode.com/ck-pacificdev/tech-test/images/{lastChar} in Postman and browser, which confirmed the URL was not reachable.

Temporary Alternative:
Substituted the provided JsonResponse model with a new model, SampleDogWoofJsonResponse, to work with the alternative URL:
https://random.dog/woof.json.
Updated the code to deserialize the response from this temporary API and confirmed the [6-9] rule's logic worked correctly.

Manual Testing:
Added logging to ensure each rule executed as expected. For example:
[6-9]: Verified response from the substitute API.
[1-5]: Verified correct retrieval of data from the SQLite database.
Other rules: Tested for vowels, special characters, and default cases.
Used test cases to ensure correct output for all scenarios.

2. How long did it take you to complete the task?
Total time: Approximately 6-7 hours. 

3. What else could be done to your solution to make it ready for production?

Error Handling:
Provide more meaningful error messages, such as "Failed to connect to external API" or "External service unavailable".
Implement retry logic for transient API failures.

Configuration:
Move external URLs like https://my-jsonserver.typicode.com/... to appsettings.json for flexibility and maintainability.

Resiliency:
Add a fallback mechanism to another API or a cached response when the primary API fails.

Testing:
Write unit tests for each rule and mock external dependencies like the API and database.
Validate with edge cases to ensure robustness.

Structured Logging:
Replace Console.WriteLine with logging frameworks like Serilog or NLog for better observability in production.

URL Issue was time consuming:

Identifying the Issue:
The provided URL: https://my-jsonserver.typicode.com/ck-pacificdev/tech-test/images/{lastChar} did not work due to DNS resolution errors. I confirmed this through testing in Postman and browser, which all indicated the domain was unreachable.

Workaround:
To proceed, I temporarily used an alternative API (https://random.dog/woof.json) and modified the response handling by creating a new model, SampleDogWoofJsonResponse, to deserialize the response correctly.

Replaced the URL and verified the [6-9] rule logic worked as intended.

Next Steps:
In a production scenario, I would confirm the correct endpoint or work with the team to ensure API availability. I would also implement fallbacks and structured error handling for external dependencies.

Key Points to Highlight
Proactive Debugging: Identified and tested alternative solutions to proceed with the task.
Adaptability: Used SampleDogWoofJsonResponse and a temporary API to validate rule functionality.
Transparency: Clearly explained the issue with the provided URL and how it was addressed.
Production-Readiness: Suggested improvements for error handling, configuration, and fallback mechanisms.
